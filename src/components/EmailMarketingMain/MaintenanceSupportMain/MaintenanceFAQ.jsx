const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "Can you support a product you didn't build?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We regularly take over existing products. We start with a codebase and infrastructure audit to understand the architecture, document any gaps, and get our engineers fully up to speed before the retainer begins.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What does "24/7 monitoring" actually mean?',
    answer:
      "Automated tools continuously track uptime, error rates, and performance metrics around the clock. If something breaks or degrades outside normal thresholds, alerts are triggered instantly and routed to our on-call engineers — day or night.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle urgent production incidents?",
    answer:
      "Critical issues are triaged immediately against your plan's SLA. Our on-call engineer investigates, applies a fix or rollback, and keeps you updated throughout — followed by a root cause summary once things are stable.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are unused hours from my retainer carried forward?",
    answer:
      "Unused engineering hours don't roll over month to month, since retainers are sized around ongoing monitoring and availability, not just banked hours. If your usage is consistently low, we're happy to revisit your plan tier.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the minimum contract period?",
    answer:
      "Our support retainers run month to month with no long-term lock-in — just 30 days' notice to pause or exit. This keeps things flexible as your product and support needs evolve.",
  },
