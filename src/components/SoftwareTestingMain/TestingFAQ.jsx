const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "Do you offer standalone QA or only with development?",
    answer:
      "Both. We work as an independent QA partner for teams that already have a dev team in place, and we also bundle QA directly into our development engagements — whichever fits how your team operates.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between manual and automated testing?",
    answer:
      "Manual testing relies on QA engineers exploring your product like real users, catching UX issues and edge cases automated scripts miss. Automated testing runs repeatable scripted checks on every code push. We combine both for full coverage.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can you start testing our product?",
    answer:
      "For most engagements we can kick off within a few days of aligning on scope — starting with a walkthrough of your product, defining the test plan, and setting up access to your environments.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which bug tracking tools do you use?",
    answer:
      "We work inside whatever tool your team already uses — Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues, and more — and can also set up a tracker for you if you don't have one, with clear severity classification and reproduction steps on every bug filed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you test mobile apps on real devices?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We test across real iOS and Android devices as well as emulators, covering functionality, performance, and UI consistency across a wide range of screen sizes and OS versions.",
  },
