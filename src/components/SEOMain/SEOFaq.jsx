const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "How long does SEO take to show results?",
    answer:
      "Most clients start seeing meaningful movement in rankings and traffic within 3–6 months, with compounding gains after that. SEO is a long-term investment — the sites we build authority for keep growing well beyond the first year.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you guarantee first-page rankings?",
    answer:
      "No ethical SEO agency can guarantee specific rankings, since search engines control their own algorithms. What we do guarantee is a transparent, white-hat strategy backed by data — and a strong track record of clients reaching page one.",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes your SEO different from others?",
    answer:
      "We combine certified specialists, 100% white-hat techniques, and full transparency — you get custom dashboards with real-time tracking and monthly strategy calls, not a black-box report you can't verify.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with small businesses?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Our plans scale from lean local businesses to high-traffic enterprise platforms, with tailored strategies like local SEO and Google Business Profile optimization for smaller, geography-focused clients.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will my rankings drop if I stop SEO?",
    answer:
      "Rankings built on genuine authority and quality content tend to hold steady for a while, but SEO isn't a one-time fix — competitors keep optimizing too. Ongoing work protects and compounds the gains rather than letting them erode.",
  },
