  {
    question: "Shopify or WooCommerce — which is better?",
    answer:
      "Shopify offers a fully managed, hassle-free platform that's great for teams who want to move fast without managing infrastructure. WooCommerce gives you more flexibility and lower ongoing platform fees if you're comfortable with WordPress. We'll recommend the right fit based on your catalog size, budget, and technical needs.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does an eCommerce store take to build?",
    answer:
      "Most stores take 6–10 weeks from kickoff to launch, depending on the number of products, custom features, and integrations like payment gateways, shipping, and inventory systems.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you migrate my existing store?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We handle migrations from any platform — moving your products, customer data, order history, and SEO rankings over safely, with careful testing to avoid downtime or lost data.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you integrate with Indian payment gateways?",
    answer:
      "Yes — we integrate Razorpay, PayU, CCAvenue, and other popular Indian payment gateways, along with UPI, net banking, and card support so your customers can pay however they prefer.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will my store be mobile-friendly?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Every store we build is fully responsive from the start, tested across mobile, tablet, and desktop — since most eCommerce traffic today comes from mobile devices.",
  },
